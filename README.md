Have you ever had a rash and quickly needed to figure out why it was there? Nearly a billion people are estimated to have skin, nail and hair fungal infections, and more than 150 million people have serious fungal diseases that have a major impact on their lives or are fatal. Furthermore, not every rash has a distinct presentation on the skin, making it hard to visually differentiate different types. Therefore, there is a need to create a model that can identify different rash classes using just an image. It can help facilitate directed and timely treatment, as some rashes signal mild conditions that can simply be treated with at-home remedies, whereas other rashes can indicate underlying medical concerns that require professional medical attention. 

By leveraging machine learning techniques, we have used a PyTorch-based CNN model to identify different rashes in accordance with user-input images. Our end goal function is an at-home app that quickly recommends to individuals the appropriate next steps (i.e. professional medical support vs. basic at-home interventions) based on the specific output rash type that is determined from the input image. The program can potentially be leveraged by healthcare professionals as a means to help them verify their patient’s rash type and provide support for a diagnosis. This model will be trained on a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subirbiswas19/skin-disease-dataset/data?select=skin-disease-datasaet) that consists of images of rashes caused by 8 Data Classes: Bacterial Infections- cellulitis, Bacterial Infections- impetigo, Fungal Infections - athlete -foot, Fungal Infections - nail-fungus, Fungal Infections - ringworm, Parasitic Infections - cutaneous-larva-migrans, Viral skin infections - chickenpox, and Viral skin infections - shingles. 

The desired accuracy of the model is at least 85% in all test cases.
